# Portfolio-website
It is my personal Static Portfolio Website created using, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Hosted on render, @https://vinitbhaiji.onrender.com/
It is a static website as the hosting platform didn't allow a PHP code to work on it. If one sees the form section it consists of 2 forms Connect.php and Contact.php in order to serve the backend for the commented form section in index.html page. one can uncomment it and can connect it to his own phpmyadmin database to operate it as a properly working website with contact forms.
